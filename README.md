# Python-Web-Scrapping
Web Scrapping to check how many images are broken on a website. This python project is done in Jupyter Notebook open source software.

## What is Web Scrapping?
  - Web scraping is a term used to describe the use of a program or algorithm to extract and process large amounts of data from the web.
  - Whether you are a data scientist, engineer, or anybody who analyzes large amounts of datasets, the ability to scrape data from the web is a useful skill to have.
  - Scraping entire html webpages is pretty easy, and scaling such a scraper isn't difficult either.
  - Things get much much harder if you are trying to extract specific information from the sites/pages. 
## Some Web Scraping Tools are:
  - Import.io.
  - Dexi.io (formerly known as CloudScrape)
  - Scrapinghub.
  - ParseHub.
  - 80legs.
  - Scraper.
 ## Python Library used :
 ### Beautiful Soup
 - It is a Python library for getting data out of HTML, XML, and other markup languages.
 - Say you've found some webpages that display data relevant to your research, such as date or address information, but that do not provide any way of downloading the data directly.
 - It sits atop an HTML or XML parser, providing Pythonic idioms for iterating, searching, and modifying the parse tree.
 ## Installation of Beautiful Soup :
 To use beautiful soup, you need to install it: 
 
              $ pip install beautifulsoup4  

 Beautiful Soup also relies on a parser, the default is lxml .
 ## Languages used :
 ### Python
  - Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language.
  - Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.
  - Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.
  - It is similar to English as the complications of writing the code is very less compared to other languages.
  - A 4 line printing code in Java can be done in 1 line in Python.
  - It can be used for other types of programming and software development besides web development
 ### Jupyter Notebook
  - The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.
  - Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.
